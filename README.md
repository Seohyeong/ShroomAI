# ShroomAI
Mushroom classification using a dataset scraped from [GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)](https://www.gbif.org/).

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises 300 mushroom images representing 1,000 different species. These species were selected based on the most commonly observed ones from iNaturalist Research-grade observations collected between 2000 and 2024, sourced from the [GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)](https://www.gbif.org/). 

Each image is associated with a specific species, selected from a hierarchical taxonomy that includes multiple layers such as family, phylum, class, order, and species. `Species` is used as labels for the images in the dataset. For further details, refer to `preprocess/preprocess.ipynb` and `preprocess/get_images.py`.

## About the Model
The backbone models used in this project are MobileNetV2 and Efficientnet-B0. Since the number of classes matches that of the ImageNet dataset, no modification to the architecture have been made. 

Training is done in two stages: training the classification head while keeping the rest of the model frozen and then training the entire model. The learning rate used in the classification head training is referred to as `partial` or `pretraining` (although it's not an entirely accurate term) and the learning rate used for training the full network is referred to as  `full` or `finetuning`.

### Experimental Results
| Backbone         | # params   | lr (partial/full) | ckpt |
|------------------|------------|-------------------|------|
| mobilenet_v2     | 3,504,872  |       |  | |
| efficientnet_b0  | 5,288,548  |      |  | |
